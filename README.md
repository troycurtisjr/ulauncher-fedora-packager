# ulauncher-fedora-packager

This is a ulauncher extension to lookup information that might be useful for Fedora packagers.

## Installation

This is currently a work in progress, so I wouldn't suggest installing it for now. If you really want to, you can do it in the usual way:

Open Ulauncher preferences window -> Extensions -> "Add extension" and paste the following url:

```
https://github.com/troycurtisjr/ulauncher-fedora-packager
```

## The rest

Once this is really ready for the world. I'll fill the rest of this out.
